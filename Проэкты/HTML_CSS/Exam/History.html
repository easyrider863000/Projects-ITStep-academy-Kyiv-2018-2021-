                 <h4>FOUNDERS</h4>
                 <p>The founders of Aston Martin brand were English gentlemen <b><em>Lionel Martin</em></b> and <b><em>Richard Bamford</em></b>.</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <div class="text-center col-10 container-fluid">
                   In 1913, Lionel Martin and Richard Bamford set up a joint business in Newport Pagnell to create sports cars based on serial models. Originally the company was called "Bamford and Martin", and the modified cars were produced under the Singer brand.

                 <h4>&laquo;BUNNY&raquo;</h4>
                 <p>Lionel Martin won the 1913 Aston Clinton track. This fact was reflected both in the name of the first own car, created in 1915, and in the name of the brand as a whole. The second sports model of the company appeared only in 1919 and was called <b><em>Bunny</em></b>.</p>

              </li>
              <div class="text-center col-10 container-fluid">
                  The fate of the brand can hardly be called cloudless. Over the long years the company has changed owners many times, was on the verge of bankruptcy and closure. But in the most critical moments of its history, there have always been such enthusiasts who picked up the falling brand banner and put their whole soul into the revival of the brand, saving a loud name from final oblivion.

                 <h4>LOGO &laquo;WINGS&raquo;</h4>
                 <p>The eagle wings first appeared on the emblem in 1927 and were borrowed from another English brand, <b><em>Bentley</em></b>. The main essence of the logo is the embodiment of the brand's rapidity and flight altitude. </p>

                   The distinctive feature of the brand is that all cars are assembled only by hand. The buyer receives a model created taking into account all his wishes and claims. This applies to materials and finishes as well as equipment. Under the hood of each car is the name of the master, who was responsible for its assembly and configuration.

                   <em><b>Count Louis Zborovski</b></em> is an English engineer and racing driver. Firstly, he provided the company with huge financial support, and secondly, he himself took an active part in Aston Martin cars in races held in Brooklands, as well as in the Grand Prix of France in 1923. The Count's condition and his sports victories brought the brand real European fame. Unfortunately, Louis' life tragically came to an end very early on: in another competition he failed to manage, crashed into a tree and died.

                 <p>During David Brown's years of ownership, the David Brown name was added to the company logo above the Aston Martin inscription, and all models were added to the name with two letters "DB". These changes in the logo and model names were abolished only in 1987.</p>
